## 字符串

### 思路总结

- 字符串处理相关题目要从结构方面考虑
- 是否对称，是否有某种规律
- 多用java本身字符串的工具！

### 题目

#### 65. Valid Number 

Validate if a given string is numeric.

Some examples:
`"0"` => `true`
`" 0.1 "` => `true`
`"abc"` => `false`
`"1 a"` => `false`
`"2e10"` => `true`

**Note:** It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one.

**Update (2015-02-10):**
The signature of the `C++` function had been updated. If you still see your function signature accepts a `const char *` argument, please click the reload button to reset your code definition.

#### 思路

- 判断有效数字
- 直接用java内置的解析函数

#### 564. [Find the Closest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/description/) 

Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.

The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "123"
Output: "121"
```

**Note:**

1. The input **n** is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
2. If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.

#### 思路

- http://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/6915355.html
- 这题不参考题解，真是想不到怎么找最接近的回文数字
  - 本身是回文字符串
    - 只需要对中间的数字进行加一或者减一，并加入后续数字的集合
  - 本身不是回文字符串
    - 要想产生最小的回文串，只有两种可能
    - 一个是左半边对折到右边
    - 另一个是右半边对折到左边
    - 加入到候选列
  - 循环找出最小的回文数字
- 其实这个算法还有很多问题
  - 比如99最小的应该是101，而不是88
- 未完成待续



#### 68. Text Justification 

Given an array of words and a width *maxWidth*, format the text such that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no **extra** space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed *maxWidth*.
- The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
             because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
             Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
         "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```

#### 44. Wildcard Matching 

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'`.

```
'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
```

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Note:**

- `s` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`.
- `p` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`, and characters like `?` or `*`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
s = "cb"
p = "?a"
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input:
s = "adceb"
p = "*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: The first '*' matches the empty sequence, while the second '*' matches the substring "dce".
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input:
s = "acdcb"
p = "a*c?b"
Output: false
```

#### 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words 

You are given a string, **s**, and a list of words, **words**, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in **s** that is a concatenation of each word in **words** exactly once and without any intervening characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodstudentgoodword",
  words = ["word","student"]
Output: []
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 123
Output: "One Hundred Twenty Three"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 12345
Output: "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 1234567
Output: "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
```

#### 32. [Longest Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/discuss/) 

Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()"
```

#### 10. Regular Expression Matching 

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`.

```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
```

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Note:**

- `s` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`.
- `p` could be empty and contains only lowercase letters `a-z`, and characters like `.` or `*`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the precedeng element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
s = "ab"
p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore it matches "aab".
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input:
s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
```

#### 214. Shortest Palindrome 

Given a string **\*s***, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"
```

        }
        if (j == s.length()) { return s; }
        String suffix = s.substring(j);
        return new StringBuffer(suffix).reverse().toString() + shortestPalindrome(s.substring(0, j)) + suffix;
    ```




#### 97. [Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/description/) 

Given *s1*, *s2*, *s3*, find whether *s3* is formed by the interleaving of *s1* and *s2*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false
```

#### 思路

- 参考思路

- 如何判断s3是由s2和s1相互交错而成的

- 解法一

  - dp

  - 行存放s1，列存放s2，内容存放true或false

  - s3当前的位置，由同一列的上一行或者同一行的上一列决定

  - 如果前置条件是true同时当前也可以匹配才能是true

  - ```java
    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
    
        if ((s1.length()+s2.length())!=s3.length()) return false;
    
        boolean[][] matrix = new boolean[s2.length()+1][s1.length()+1];
    
        matrix[0][0] = true;
    
        for (int i = 1; i < matrix[0].length; i++){
            matrix[0][i] = matrix[0][i-1]&&(s1.charAt(i-1)==s3.charAt(i-1));
        }
    
        for (int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++){
            matrix[i][0] = matrix[i-1][0]&&(s2.charAt(i-1)==s3.charAt(i-1));
        }
    
        for (int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++){
            for (int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++){
                matrix[i][j] = (matrix[i-1][j]&&(s2.charAt(i-1)==s3.charAt(i+j-1)))
                        || (matrix[i][j-1]&&(s1.charAt(j-1)==s3.charAt(i+j-1)));
            }

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]] 
Explanation: The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["bat","tab","cat"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]] 
Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
```

#### 76. [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

```
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

**Note:**

- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

#### 思路

- 找出S的最短子字符串，其中包含T字符串的字母就行
- 个人解法
  - 用两个指针，一头一尾，先移动尾巴，一直到包围T后
  - 再移动头部，记录最短的长度就行
  - 终止条件尾巴到最后一个元素，而头部到极限位置就行了

#### 87. Scramble String 

Given a string *s1*, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of *s1* = `"great"`:

```
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```

To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node `"gr"` and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string `"rgeat"`.

```
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```

We say that `"rgeat"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes `"eat"` and `"at"`, it produces a scrambled string `"rgtae"`.

```
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
```

We say that `"rgtae"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Given two strings *s1* and *s2* of the same length, determine if *s2* is a scrambled string of *s1*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
Output: false
```

            if(s1.length()!=s2.length()) return false;
            
            int[] letters = new int[26];
            int len = s1.length();
            for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
                letters[s1.charAt(i)-'a']++;
                letters[s2.charAt(i)-'a']--;
            }
            for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
                if(letters[i]!= 0) return false;
            }
            
            for(int i = 1; i < len; i++){
                if(isScramble(s1.substring(0,i), s2.substring(0,i)) && isScramble(s1.substring(i), s2.substring(i))) return true;
                if(isScramble(s1.substring(0,i), s2.substring(len-i)) && isScramble(s1.substring(i), s2.substring(0,len-i))) return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```



#### 591. Tag Validator 

Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

1. The code must be wrapped in a **valid closed tag**. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
2. A **closed tag** (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is **valid** if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
3. A **valid** `TAG_NAME` only contain **upper-case letters**, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is **invalid**.
4. A **valid** `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other **valid closed tags**, **cdata** and any characters (see note1) **EXCEPT** unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is **invalid**.
5. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
6. A `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
7. The cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the **first subsequent** `]]>`.
8. `CDATA_CONTENT` may contain **any characters**. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as **regular characters**.

**Valid Code Examples:**

```
Input: "<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>"

Output: True

Explanation: 

The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 

The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 

Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.

So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.


Input: "<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>"

Output: True

Explanation:

We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.

start_tag -> "<DIV>"

end_tag -> "</DIV>"

tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.

text1 -> ">>  ![cdata[]] "

cdata -> "<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>", where the CDATA_CONTENT is "<div>]>"

text2 -> "]]>>]"


The reason why start_tag is NOT "<DIV>>>" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT "<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>" is because of the rule 7.
```

**Invalid Code Examples:**

```
Input: "<A>  <B> </A>   </B>"
Output: False
Explanation: Unbalanced. If "<A>" is closed, then "<B>" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Input: "<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>"
Output: False

Input: "<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>"
Output: False
```

**Note:**

1. For simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the **any characters** mentioned above) only contain `letters`, `digits`, `'<'`,`'>'`,`'/'`,`'!'`,`'['`,`']'` and `' '`.

#### 115. [Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/description/) 

Given a string **S** and a string **T**, count the number of distinct subsequences of **S** which equals **T**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```

 

#### 思路

- 个人解法：dp

  - 行代表S，列代表T，内容代表能匹配的个数
  - 每一个内容的位置如果匹配要加上前一列的内容并加1，否则直接加上前一列。然后还要加上上一行的内容。否则不加。

- 正确解法

  - 其实上述解法已经接近正确答案了。

  - 递推方面，想要对第一行和第一列做初始化

  - 然后从左向右推进的时候，要考虑是否匹配，如果不匹配可以直接赋值上一列，如果匹配就还要加上上一列上一行位置的次数即可。

  - ```
    class Solution {
    public:
        int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
            int m = t.length(), n = s.length();
            vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int> (n + 1, 0));
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) dp[0][j] = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
                for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + (t[i - 1] == s[j - 1] ? dp[i - 1][j - 1] : 0);
            return dp[m][n];
        }
    };  
    ```



#### 72. [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/) 

Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of operations required to convert *word1* to *word2*.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

  - 三种情况
  - 行代表WORD1，列代表WORD2,内容代表距离
  - 只有2比1短的时候需要添加字符串，只有2比1长的时候需要减少字符串
  - 所以第一行和第一列可以直接初始化
  - 剩下的根据三种情况直接找最短的距离，三个位置，左上角，上方和左方
  - 相等的情况直接等于左上角



#### 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences 

Given a string S, find the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in S, and **return that number modulo 10^9 + 7.**

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
S = 'bccb'
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.
Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
S = 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba'
Output: 104860361
Explanation: 
There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 10^9 + 7.
```

**Note:**

The length of `S` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

Each character `S[i]` will be in the set `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`.

#### 632. [Smallest Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range/description/) 

You have `k` lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the **smallest** range that includes at least one number from each of the `k`lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if `b-a < d-c` or `a < c` if `b-a == d-c`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
```

**Note:**

1. The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
2. 1 <= `k` <= 3500
3. -105 <= `value of elements` <= 105.
4. **For Java users, please note that the input type has been changed to List<List<Integer>>. And after you reset the code template, you'll see this point.**

#### 761. [Special Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-binary-string/description/) 

*Special* binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.

Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

Given a special string `S`, a *move* consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of `S`, and swapping them. *(Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)*

At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
Explanation:
The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
```

**Note:**

1. `S` has length at most `50`.
2. `S` is guaranteed to be a *special* binary string as defined above.
